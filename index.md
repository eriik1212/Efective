## About the game

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, released in 1989, is a Beat 'em Up videogame based on the first TMNT animated series that began in 1987. The game was developed by Konami for the arcade machines of that time.

The objective of the game is saving April O'Neil and Splinter, two iconic characters of the serie, and defeat the evil Shredder. To do that, the player has to pass through different levels and overthrow an iconic boss at the end of each level.

The gameplay mechanics are simple: an Horizontal Scrolling Interface System combined with intuitive controls that allow the player to have a complete Movement (Up, Down, Left, Right) and have two action buttons (Jump and Attack). TMNT is a 2D videogame, but due to the complete movement system and the background design, the game generates a false sentation of 3D.
